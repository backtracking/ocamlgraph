  (* The algorithm of Eades, Lin, and Smyth (ELS 1993) works by "scheduling"
     vertexes onto two lists called s1 and s2. At each iteration a vertex is
     chosen, scheduled, and removed from the graph. Arcs from a newly scheduled
     node toward nodes already in s1 are classified as "leftward"; they are
     included in the generated feedback arc set. "Rightward" arcs, to vertexes
     in s2 or that have not yet been scheduled, are not included in the
     feedback arc set. The algorithm tries to maximize the number of rightward
     arcs and thereby minimize the number of leftward ones. Source vertexes,
     those with no incoming arcs in the current graph (i.e., because all its
     predecssors have already been scheduled), are appended directly onto s1
     and do not induce any feedback arcs. Sink vertexes are consed directly
     onto s2 and do not induce any feedback arcs. Otherwise, the algorithm
     chooses a vertex to maximize the difference between the number of
     outgoing arcs and the number of incoming ones: the (remaining) incoming
     arcs must be included in the feedback arc set. The difference between the
     number of rightward arcs (no cost) and the number of leftward arcs
     (feedback arcs) is called "delta". The algorithm is implemented
     efficiently by using a data structure to group unscheduled vertexes
     according to their delta value. When more than one vertex has the maximum
     delta value, the original algorithm makes an arbitrary choice. The
     algorithm of Eades and Lin (EL 1995) makes the choice using a heuristic
     that maximizes the difference between incoming arcs and outgoing ones in
     the vertexes that remain at the end of the iteration as such vertexes are
     the most "unbalanced" and thus less likely to contribute to the feedback
     arc set in future iterations. The EL 1995 algorithm includes a further
     refinement to ignore chains of vertexes when looking for unbalanced ones,
     since such chains do not contribute feedback arcs.

     Since we just want to produce a list of feedback arcs, we don't bother
     tracking order in s1, and we only track s2 to properly handle the
     preprocessing optimization that removes two cycles. We maintain lists of
     source and sink vertexes (scheduled but not yet removed from the graph)
     and a map from delta values to sets of vertexes. As the delta value map
     caches the state of the graph, it must be updated when the a vertex is
     scheduled and removed from the graph. Additionally, we remember which two
     cycles were removed during preprocessing and ensure that one of their
     arcs is included in the feedback arc set, depending on whichever of the
     two interlinked vertexes is scheduled first. *)

  (* The original article proposes preprocessing the graph to condense long

     contribute any leftward arcs (when the last vertex is removed, they
     become a sequence of sinks). Using such a preprocessing step with
     weighted edges risks removing good feedback arcs, i.e., those with a big
